        like Red-Small, Red-Medium, Red-Large, etc, this can be used for while adding the Shirt. <br><br>

        <strong>Solution 2, Create multiple Products:</strong> Create multiple different products like Shirt-Red,
        Shirt-Green, Shirt-Blue with size as variations. When you create multiple products you will NOT have to enter the
        same details multiple times, first, add the Shirt-Red with all size variations of it and then use the Duplicate
        Product action to copy the data. <br>

      <p class="my-4 text-base text-gray-700">
        While adding variable products, you can select only the required variation values. <br> <br>
